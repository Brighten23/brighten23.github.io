<h1 style="font-family:courier; text-align:center;"> How to get Certified as a Personal Trainer and the Rules you must follow: </h1>
	<p>First, a personal trainer must be certified by a valid
certifying agency. The agency that I recommend is the National
Academy of Sports Science. NASM, for short, offers an extensive
six month course. At the end of the course you must pass a test 
and be CPR/AED certified in order to obtain a personal training 
license. Once a personal trainer is granted his/her license there 
are many fundamentals and rules he/she must follow. The first rule 
is to train for the right reasons. A personal trainer must want to
help people reach their fitness goals more than anything else. The 
second fundamental is to use terminology that clients can comprehend.
The third rule is to lead by example, show them how exercises are 
correctly performed. The fourth rule is to keep them motivated and on
track while at the same time keeping them informed about their nutrition.
Finally, a personal trainer must keep their fitness in a healthy state, so
that they can lead by example. As well as, they must constantly be furthering
their education on the subject to provide new and relevant techniques for their
clients to utilize in order to keep their fitness a priority. 
<h2 style="text-decoration:underline"> The OPT Model: </h2>
<p> The OPT Model is the model that I follow to make sure that my clients
develop all the skills to train. It is a model that starts everyone at a 
beginner level and depending on how athletic and fit they are is what will
decide how fast they progress through this program. The OPT Model is the 
follwing:
<ol>
<li> Stabilization Endurance Training </li>
<li> Strength Endurance Training </li>
<li> Hypertrophy Training </li>
<li> Maximal Strength Training </li>
<li> Power Training </li>
</ol>
<p> Below I will include a picture of the OPT Model that way you can better
understand the way it builds upon itself. It's kind of like a food pyramind:

<h2> This looks just like weight training. Do you incorporate cardio respiratory 
training as well? </h2>
<p> The answer to that question is yes. Cardio respiratory training is imperative in
any training program that my clients participate in. There are tons of benefits to 
cardio respiratory training. A few of these benefits are:
<ul>
<li> Helps treat anxiety, deppression, and other mental health issues </li>
<li> Prevents type 2 diabetes and obesity </li>
<li> Reduces the chances of having a stroke or heart attack </li>
<li> Improves coordination and bone density </li>
<li> Promotes fat loss and can cure cravings </li>
</ul>

<h2><big>But Brighten, how come you do not follow your OPT Model exactly? Don't you need to practice what you preach?</big></h2>
<p>
The answer to this question is yes I do need to practice what I preach. But, I am now an experienced fitness instructor.
I have been lifting for over seven years. I have completed the OPT Model and I have decided to entertain myself with
other styles of training. I do a chest and tricep day, back and bicep day, and leg and shoulders day. This is called a 
split. A split is when you train seperate large muscle groups on different days. You can see my training schedule in the table below:
I always stretch before every single workout. I also stretch before I go to bed and right when I wake up in the 
morning. Stretching is imperative for a person to stay healthy. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L2lnxIcNmo"> Click this link to see my stretching
